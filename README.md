# Criminal Record Management System

This system provides a concrete solution for the criminal record storage 
providing security, scalability, and accessibility of immutable criminal records 
across the country or at worldwide scale. The paper aims to reduce the bottleneck 
and long validating process of one’s criminal record credibility. The paper 
proposes a decentralized private blockchain making use of PoA (Proof of 
Authority) consensus protocol. The implementation of the proposed model is done 
by creating Decentralized applications (D-Apps) with the help of Flask 
microframework using SHA-256 for hashing the blocks and RSA cryptographic 
algorithms for PoA consensus. The distributed ledger contains criminal records of 
an individual.
The different types of authorities play a versatile role in ledger management 
and accessibility of the ledger.
